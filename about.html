All his time since the age of 18 was dedicated to teaching English at institutions and Aviation university.  After immigrating to US he started a job as a car salesman, but as long as he has always been interested in more academic environments, started doing some research to see what major fits him the best here in Seattle area. After almost 3 months, Coding and programming got the highest ranking and he enrolled in Code-Fellows class. His goal is to be able to to get a decent job and create some educational applications for kids and adults, both in languages and wildlife fields.

        <p>No real experience doing anything. Spent most of personal time before   CodeFellows   developing artistic skills.
        Goal with studying code: Be so darn good at code that my linkedIn account gets spammed with job requests and never have to worry about supporting my daughter again. Then finance a personal art studio/freelance business.

        <p>I have a diverse background including the military, construction, roughnecking, e-commerce management, and retail management. Hopefully I can take what I learn here at Codefellows and make mad skrilla. I thought this project was cool because it gives kids a cool way to interact with their parents and express themselves.

        <p> I spent most of my career in finance.  The later part of my career I worked for technology startup companies.  That was when my passion for technology and the desire to understand how products are built from a technical perspective really started.  I’m glad that I’m a part of Code Fellows program.
